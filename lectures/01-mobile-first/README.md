#### Responsive Web Design
* RWD vs. AWD
  * Why responsive development?
    * Larger coverage area
    * Multiple device support
    * Think: spandex
    * Example: [The Outline](https://theoutline.com/)
  * Why adaptive development?
    * AKA dynamic serving
    * Server determines what HTML, CSS, etc assets a device will receive
    * Accessibility, not everyone has the latest tech that can render large responsive websites
    * Think: wardrobe of interchangable clothes of all shapes and sizes
    * Example: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)
* How to implement RWD
  * Viewports
    * Using the meta viewport tag and it’s width and scale options
  * Media Queries
    * Using min-width media query for mobile first design and development
    * High level overview of other media queries and options
  * Flexible Media
    * Using `max-width` for scalable images
  * Use an icon font
    * [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/)
  * Flexible layouts, libraries
    * [Flexbox](https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/umrnE) and [CSS grid](https://codepen.io/stacy/pen/JbyYRr)
    * Modern 960px grid systems
    * Common responsive frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation)
    * Width based resizing and scalability of elements
* SMACSS
  * Modular CSS - why use it?
  * Modules: base, layout, module, state, and theme

## Lab Prep & Git Flow
* Live-server
  * Install it with npm: `npm install -g live-server`
  * What's it do?
  * How to use it?
* Git flow for Pair Programming Lab
  * Talk about "What is a remote?"
    * "What remotes do we have?" (`origin` is default; we'll have `upstream` in the labs, and when we do deployment on Day 13, we'll add `heroku`)
    * What does `git pull upstream master` do?
    * Example Git flow for pair assignments are located in the lab README.
  * To Submit your Pair Lab:
    * Make a PR to the `upstream` repo, and submit its unique link
