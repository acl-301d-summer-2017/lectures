## Learning Objectives
- Describe the different parts of the MVC design pattern.
- Include the jQuery library using a CDN or including it locally.
- Describe the pros and cons of using jQuery.
- Perform DOM manipulations using `append`, `remove`, `clone`, `data`, `html`, `text`.
- Traverse the DOM tree, with `parents`, `children`, `find`.
- Differentiate between certain methods & the process of chaining.
- Include JavaScript files accounting for dependencies by loading `<script>` tags in order.

## Notes

#### Agile and MVC
* Overview
  * Agile Web Development
    * [Infographic](https://toggl.com/developer-methods-infographic)
    * Compared with the ‘Waterfall’ process
    * Some ways to implement agile:
      * Daily Sprints
      * ‘MVP’ & ‘Stretch’ Goals
      * User (or project stakeholder) stories & Developer stories
      * Iterative Development
      * Agile buzzwords (backlog, sprint demos, retrospective, etc)
  * MVC
    * Why do developers care about separating these concerns?
    * What are some other architectural design patterns?
      * MVP: Model View Presenter
      * MVVM: Model View View Model
      * Component Based Architecture
    * What does each MVC layer do?
    * How does each MVC layer tie together in a modern web application?
    * Additional resources:
      * [MVC Architecture ](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_frameworks)
      * [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns: MVC](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvcmvp)

#### DOM & jQuery
* Overview
  * Including jQuery from CDN/locally sourced
  * Vanilla DOM selection & manipulation review
  * Basic jQuery syntax
  * Waiting for DOM load using `$(document).ready()`;
  * Basic CSS selector review - how this works with jQuery selection
    * Each jQuery selection attempts to return a set of matched elements, and if it cannot, will return an empty array-like object.
  * Chaining methods
    * Why are we able to chain in jQuery?
      * Each method returns a jQuery object
  * Understanding the "getter" and “setter” differences between single and double parameter jQuery method calls
    * Ex:`$(‘.el’).attr(‘some-data-attribute’)`- gets the attribute
    * Ex:`$(‘.el’).attr(‘some-data-attribute’, ‘some val’)`- sets the attribute

####  Lab Prep
* Walk through today's TODOS
  * 'use strict';
  * Two new array methods:
    * sort
    * forEach
