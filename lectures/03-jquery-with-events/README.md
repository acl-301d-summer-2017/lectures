## Notes
* Maryus, Christina Code Review
    * [commit](https://github.com/acl-301d-summer-2017/lab-02-jquery-and-dom/commit/dea9c52146e7c2c25598486df680c81fe2c622e5)

* jQuery Events
    * Review
        * Attach event listeners to HTML elements
        * Events are handled by callback functions (our event handlers)
        * Event handling can be used to override default behavior (like link click, or form submit)
        * Vanilla JS events recap (pg. 244)
    * jQuery events
        * Examples: click, change/input, scroll
        * With jQuery, event listeners should be registered with `$.on()`
        * `$.on()`
            * Discuss `$.on()` with and without delegation.
        * Event delegation
            * How to add event listeners to dynamically created and inserted elements?
