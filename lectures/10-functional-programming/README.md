## Notes
* [Code-review](https://github.com/acl-301d-summer-2017/09-sql-joins-relations/pull/5)
* Functional Programming
    * "Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.  Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function."
    * Scope
        * Basics of scoping
    * Closures
        * IIFE
        * Encapsulation
        * The Javascript Module Pattern
    * Declarative vs Imperative code
        * Provide examples of imperative coding
        * Provide examples of declarative programming - using JavaScript array methods like** map, filter**, and **reduce**
    * Stateless (Pure) functions
    * Immutability
        * Provide examples
    * First-class functions
        * **forEach**
        * **map**
        * **reduce**
        * **filter**
